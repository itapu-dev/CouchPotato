# CouchPotato

Have you always been referred to as a couch potato? Congratulations, now you can finally use this talent and challenge your friends.

###### How?
Invite them to the CouchPotatoe challenge and track the time everyone spends at home. Those who endure the longest get the most points and thus increase their trophy collection.
###### Why?
For your own protection, for the protection of the older generation and to support the optimal coping with this exceptional situation, each individual contributes to the virus not spreading any further.
###### So:
Join in, stay@home and be a couch potato and part of an immensely important movement: **WirVsVirus**
